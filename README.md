# Student_Scheduler
The AOK Library Student Scheduler will fulfill the purpose of allowing library student staff to log their work schedules for the semester in an online format. Additionally the Library Scheduler will allow the supervisor(s) to the student staff individual access to each of the studentsâ€™ schedules for the purposes of viewing, editing, and communication. The product will allow for each user to view the current work schedule by week or month. The product will be developed using a javascript framework and will facilitate the creation of a web application which will be hosted locally on a server in the AOK Library.
